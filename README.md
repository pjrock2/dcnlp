Drug overdose classification using NLP

To use this code, create a file with three fields from your death certificate data: 
  1. "DC_YEAR", the year of death
  2. "OD", a 0/1 indicator if a record is an overdose death or not
  3. "scan_field", a field consisting of the free-text fields from the death certificates 
     that you wish to use for classification, with all punctuation removed, capitalized
